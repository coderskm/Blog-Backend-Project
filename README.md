## Mini Blog Backend Project

### Models
- Author Model
```
{ fname: { mandatory}, lname: {mandatory}, title: {mandatory, enum[Mr, Mrs, Miss]}, email: {mandatory, valid email, unique}, password: {mandatory} }
```
- Blogs Model
```
{ title: {mandatory}, body: {mandatory}, authorId: {mandatory, refs to author model}, category: {string, mandatory, examples: [technology, entertainment, life style, food, fashion]}, createdAt, updatedAt, deletedAt: {when the document is deleted}, isDeleted: {boolean, default: false}, publishedAt: {when the blog is published}, isPublished: {boolean, default: false}}
```

### Author APIs /authors
- Create a author document from request body.
  `Endpoint: BASE_URL/authors`

### POST /login
- Allow an author to login with their email and password. On a successful login attempt return a JWT token contatining the authorId
- If the credentials are incorrect return a suitable error message with a valid HTTP status code

### Authentication
- Add an authorisation implementation for the JWT token that validates the token before every protected endpoint is called. If the validation fails, return a suitable error message with a corresponding HTTP status code
- Protected routes are create a blog, edit a blog, get the list of blogs, delete a blog(s)
- Set the token, once validated, in the request - `x-api-key`
- Use a middleware for authentication purpose.

### Authorisation
- Make sure that only the owner of the blogs is able to edit or delete the blog.
- In case of unauthorized access return an appropirate error message.

### POST /blogs
- Create a blog document from request body. Get authorId in request body only.
- Make sure the authorId is a valid authorId by checking the author exist in the authors collection.
- Return HTTP status 201 on a succesful blog creation. Also return the blog document. 
- Return HTTP status 400 for an invalid request.

### PUT /blogs/:blogId
- Updates a blog by changing the its title, body, adding tags, adding a subcategory. (Assuming tag and subcategory received in body is need to be added)
- Updates a blog by changing its publish status i.e. adds publishedAt date and set published to true
- Check if the blogId exists (must have isDeleted false). If it doesn't, return an HTTP status 404 with a response body like [this](#error-response-structure)
- Return an HTTP status 200 if updated successfully with a body like [this](#successful-response-structure) 
- Also make sure in the response you return the updated blog document. 

### DELETE /blogs/:blogId
- Check if the blogId exists( and is not deleted). If it does, mark it deleted and return an HTTP status 200 without any response body.
- If the blog document doesn't exist then return an HTTP status of 404 with a body like [this](#error-response-structure)
